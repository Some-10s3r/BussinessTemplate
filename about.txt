here are some notes on the project for more understanding of its structure:
the html is simple so is the case with css and js (i tried to make this project simple yet effective)

HTML:
the navbar consists of logo then list of links that are linked to the different sections and a buttom (linked to the sign up section) // as for mobiles the links will be put in a hamburger and got rid of the sign up button
the about section consists of title, subtitle , a description of the section and a button (linked to the sign up section)
the services section consists of title and a bunch of cards each containing an image , a title (linked to the sign up section) and a descripting of that service
the sign up section (basically a copy of the about section with different content) almost every link brings you up to this section that its button redirects you to the actual sign up page
finally,the footer which is fairly simple as well

CSS:
(fonts,icons:fontawesome)      //font:'Kumbh Sans', sans-serif//
To begin with , there are some common styles that i just put their classes in main.css
the about and sign up sections are about the same so their styles are put in the same stylesheet "about.css"

In the services section , the images are from the internet put in the src folder

I tried to put the least number of classes i could (while perserving the flexibility) so things don't get messy 
i also focused on the responsivility and the compatibility of the browser (i may have forgot some items)

that's about it for the css

JS:
2 files for 2 buttons' fonctunality
hamb.js : takes care of the navabar's hamburger for mobiles
dark-light.js : takes care of the theme and colors (light/dark theme)
